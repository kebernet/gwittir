 * An immutable duration specifying a length of time in milliseconds.

 * A duration is defined by a fixed number of milliseconds.
 * There is no concept of fields, such as days or seconds, as these fields can vary in length.
 * A duration may be converted to a {@link Period} to obtain field values.
 * This conversion will typically cause a loss of precision however.
 * <p>
 * Duration is thread-safe and immutable.
