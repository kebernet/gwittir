<p>
    An extended GWT JRE Emulation Library that picks up where GWT's basic set left off.
</p>
<p>
    Effort is made to ensure the JRE emulated library is as API compatible as possible.
    <!--
    Where there are behavioral incompatibilities, it will be documented. If a method or class
    has no documentation then assume emulated behavior is identical.
    -->
</p>
<p>
    You can import the entire GWTx project by adding the following import to your .gwt.xml file:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <code>
        &lt;inherits name="com.googlecode.gwtx.Java"/&gt;
    </code>
