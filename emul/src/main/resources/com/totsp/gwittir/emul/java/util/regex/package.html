    Emulation of a java.util.regex package, based on
    <a href='http://gwt-widget.sourceforge.net/'>gwt-widgets</a>.

    As a side note, it's worth mentioning that regular expressions used in GWT
    will be evaluated in the JavaScript world and not the Java world. There are
    slight syntactic differences between the two, so while looking up references
    for regular expressions, you should consult resources for JavaScript regex
    rather than Java.

    Todo : implement a Java to JS regexp converter ? @see gwt emul for String#matches
